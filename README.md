# Sharpening C Skills

This is not a serious repo. I haven't written C in a while so I'm writing
some quick little programs to see how much I remember and how much I have
to Google.

I'm only putting this up as a personal back-up.

All programs compiled and run with:
```
gcc -o main main.c
./main
```
